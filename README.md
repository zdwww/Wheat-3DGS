## Updates
- <b>[5/2/2025]</b>  Code for wheat head morphology calculation released at `wheatheadsmorphology`
- <b>[4/30/2025]</b> Initial code release 

## üìù TODO List
- \[ \] Insllation instruction
- \[ \] Viser-based 3D wheat head segmentation viewer

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
The setup should be very similar to the original [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) except we used a modified version of [differential gaussian rasterization](https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization/tree/8829d14f814fccdaf840b7b0f3021a616583c0a1) with support of depth & alpha rendering, and an additional [flashsplat-rasterization](https://github.com/florinshen/flashsplat-rasterization/tree/189c483ffa33dd6d5661343ce496df0c6eb80a0c) submodule. We will release the complete `requirements.txt` later.

## Using Wheat3DGS
The majority of the Wheat3DGS pipeline can be executed by running this script.
```
sbatch run_wheat_3dgs.sh
```

## Baseline
To reproduce the baseline results presented in the paper (i.e. [FruitNeRF](https://github.com/meyerls/FruitNeRF)), please refer to the original repository and the scripts in the `scripts` folder.

## Acknowledgement
Our implementation is based on the original [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and [FlashSplat](https://github.com/florinshen/FlashSplat). We thank the authors for their revolutionary work and open-source contributions.
